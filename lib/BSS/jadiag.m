% syntaxe       [a, c] = jadiag(c, a, eps, maxiter)

% Performs approximate joint diagonalization of several matrices.
% The matrices to be diagonalised are given in concatenated form by a
% m x n matrix c, n being a multiple of m. They are transformed to nearly
% diagonal and the transformation is also applied to a. Thus a yields the
% diagonalising matrix if it is initialised by the identity matrix (the
% default), otherwise it is the product of the diagonalsing matrix
% with its initialized value.
% The stoping criterion is that the square norm (with respect to a
% certain metric) of the relative "gradient" is less than eps or the
% number of step attains maxstep. The above squared norm also equals
% approximatively the decrease of the criterion at this step.
% eps defaults to m*(m-1)*1e-4, maxiter to 15 and a to the identity matrix

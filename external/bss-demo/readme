To launch this demo simply type bliss
Users of matlab-5 must type however bliss5. The reason is that this
software (specifically its user interface part) was developed under
matlab-6 and uses some functions which are not found in matlab-5.
These functions are stored in the sub-directory matlab-6 (users of
matlab-6 can delete this sub-directory). In spite of that, under
matlab-5, you often get the message

Bad index in cell array expansion.

Such messages seem to have no effect and can be ignored.
